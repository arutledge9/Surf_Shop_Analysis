# surfs_up
Module 9 coursework w/ python, sqlite, flask


## Summary

I have been working with my friend W. Avy to analyze the feasibility of opening up a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, since we both love surfing and ice cream so much. However, we don't want to rush in without a full analysis of all data and weather points, because we'd hate to launch our dream venture only to see it fail due to weather behavior we could have easily researched and anticipated with a little foresight. We've been working with SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask on all of our analyses, which until this point have looked at a year's worth of precipitation data across a number of Hawaiian Islands weather stations, as well as temperature data from the most active station. W. Avy has asked me to take a final look at the historical temperature data in June and also in December to make sure our shop can remain open year-round.
